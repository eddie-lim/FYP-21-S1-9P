Duration of each lesson is 2-3 hours.\r\n\r\nA blended learning approach is adopted. Not only students learn through the resources/content and instruction via digital and online media. Students also prepare ahead for discussion, produce coursework or project work; face-to-face sessions emphasize on discussions, case studies, and hands-on exercises. In class, the lecturer facilitates discussion and learning. As such, a large amount of time is spent on a mixture of:\r\n\r\nlectures\r\nlab works\r\ncomputer simulation sessions\r\nonline learning through Coursera platform*\r\n* Coursera: The BSc Computer Science (CS) programme is fully developed and taught by the same faculty that teaches on-campus at University of London. The University of London leverages Coursera’s online education platform to deliver the programme curriculum, allowing BSc CS students to benefit from Coursera features such as interactive video transcription, in-course note taking, and seamless learning across multiple devices.\r\n\r\nAt SIM, lecturers guide students to leverage the resources available on Coursera and facilitate the learning that takes place. The supplementary readings, video lectures, assignments, and discussion forums are extensively discussed in class. Students also collaborate on group projects using Zoom and Slack. Students may access all course materials anywhere with the mobile app on Coursera, available on iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nUsing the mobile app, learners can: (1) Save a week’s worth of content for offline access with one click (2) Save and submit quizzes offline (3) View text transcripts of lecture videos (4) Take notes directly in the app (5) Set reminder alerts to help you make progress\r\n\r\nMode of Study\r\nClasses are held in 2/3-hour blocks between Monday and Friday, starting at 8.30am, 12pm or 3.30pm.
